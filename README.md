# Deformable Image Registration
This README explains the different notebooks that are part of this project, what they need and what they produce.
This project register two respiratory time points of thoracic CT scans of 6 different patients automatically.

To execute the code follow [this guide](https://simpleitk.org/SPIE2019_COURSE/) to set up your environment.

## project2_FFD_hyperparameters_search.ipynb
This notebook computes a hyperparameters search with the Free Form Deformation algorithm 
over the 6 patients.
You can define a parameters grid and the notebook automatically executes the registration
with all the combinations of the parameters in the grid. It saves all the results and relevant data.

## project2_FFD_hp_results analysis.ipynb
This notebooks loads all the results generated by ```project2_FFD_hyperparameters_search.ipynb``` and allows you to analyze them. The notebook generates a table with all the metrics
and sort them to select the parameters combination which gives the lower R.

## project2_FFD_results.ipynb
This notebook computes the Free Form Deformation algorithm over the 6 patients with the
parameters that are defined. These parameters are the ones that give the best score in the hyperparameters search, selected by the notebook ```project2_FFD_hp_results analysis.ipynb```.
This notebook generates all the final metrics, saves the transformation and the transformed
images, masks and landmarks. Also, generate some relevant plots.
